Data from Untappd, a beer-rating site with 7m (mostly American) users, confirm that pontificating pint swillers turn their noses up at mass market lager. Among the 5,000 beers its users reported drinking most often, lagers made with “bottom- fermenting” yeast, which yields a light bodied, mild brew are rated 3.29 out of 5 on average. The rest get an average of 3.69.
