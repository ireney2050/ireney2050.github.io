SQL view is a kind of virtual table that has rows and columns as they are in a real database. The view can be accompanied with all the rows of a particular table or selected rows based on a certain condition. In Structured Query Language, a view is a virtual table based on the result-set of an SQL statement.

# **SQL VIEWS**

SQL view contains rows and columns, just like the real table. The fields in the view are fields from one or more real tables in the database. You can add the SQL functions, [WHERE](https://appdividend.com/2019/04/10/sql-where-clause-example-sql-where-query-tutorial/), and [JOIN](https://appdividend.com/2019/06/13/sql-joins-tutorial-for-beginners-sql-joins-example/) statements to the view and present data as if that data were coming from a single table.

# **#CREATING VIEWS**

Let’s create views using single tables or multiple tables.

# **#Syntax**

```
Create View View_name AS
Select column(s)
From table_name
Where condition;
```

# **#Parameters**

1. View_name: Name of the View.
2. Column(s): Name of the column.
3. Table_name: Name of the table.
4. Where: This is used for specifying some conditions.

# **#Query: (Creating View With a single table)**

```
Create view Details AS
Select name, city
From Student
Where id>=1;
```

# **#Output**

Type the following query to get the output.

```
Select * from Details;
```

# **#Query: (Creating Views from Multiple Tables)**

```
Create View Marks AS
Select Student.Name, Student.City, Marks.Marks
From Student, Marks
Where Student.Name=Marks.Name;
```

# **#Output**

Fire the following query.

```
Select * from Marks;
```

# **#DELETING VIEWS**

Views can be removed with the help of the DROP Statement.

# **#Syntax**

```
Drop VIEW view_name;
```

See the following parameters.

# **#Parameters**

View_name: This is the name of the View which you want to delete.

# **#Query**

```
Drop VIEW Details;
```

So, the View Details will be deleted which we had created above.

So, we have learned how to delete views.

Let’s learn how to update views.

# **#UPDATING VIEWS**

Views can be updated with the help of Create or replace statements.

# **#SYNTAX:**

```
Create or Replace View View_Name AS
Select column(s)
From table_name
Where condition;
```

# **#PARAMETERS:**

1. View_name: Name of the View.
2. Column(s): Name of the column.
3. Table_name: Name of the table.
4. Where: This is used for specifying some conditions.

Let’s clear this with the help of an example.

Suppose, we want to add student Age as well in Marks view then the following queries has to be written.

# **#QUERY**

```
Create or replace View MARKS AS
Select Student.Name, Student.City, Marks.Marks, Marks.Age
From Student, Marks
Where Student.Name=Marks.Name;
```

# **#Output**

```
Select * from MARKS;
```

See the output.

# **#Inserting a row in a view.**

We can insert values in view as that of we insert into the table.

# **#Syntax**

```
Insert into view_name (column(s)) VALUES (values);
```

# **#Parameters**

View_name: This is the name of the View which you want to delete.

# **#Query**

```
INSERT INTO DETAILS (Name, City) VALUES(‘Aman’,’Patna’);
```

# **#Output**

```
Select * from DETAILS;
```

We have considered here the view details which were previously created in CREATE VIEW Query.

# **#Deleting a row from a view**

We can Delete the details from the view using the [DELETE](https://appdividend.com/2019/07/11/sql-delete-query-tutorial-delete-statement-in-sql-example/) statement.

# **#Syntax**

```
DELETE FROM view_name where Condition;
```

# **#Parameters**

View_name: This is the name of the View which you want to delete.

# **#Query**

```
Delete from details where name=”Aman”;
```

# **#Output:**

Fire the following query.

```
Select * from Details;
```

# **# SQL Views Keynote:**

One should keep in his/her mind to consider these following points before updating the views.

1. [Group by](https://appdividend.com/2019/05/21/sql-group-by-example-group-by-clause-in-sql-tutorial/) Clause and [Order By](https://appdividend.com/2019/06/04/sql-order-by-clause-example-sql-order-by-tutorial/) clause should not be included with the create statement.
2. [DISTINCT](https://appdividend.com/2019/06/21/sql-distinct-keyword-tutorial-distinct-statement-in-sql-example/) keyword should not be present with the select statement.
3. The view should not contain any NULL values.
4. The views should not be created with Nested Queries or Complex Queries.
5. Views should not be created with multiple views.
