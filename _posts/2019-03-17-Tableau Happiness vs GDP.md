There are important examples of national income and happiness rising and falling together. Among rich countries Germany enjoys higher incomes and greater cheer than
ten years ago. Venezuela, once the fifth happiest country in the world, has become miserable as its economy has collapsed.
Looking across countries, growth is correlated with rising happiness.

Like China,India is a populous developing economy that is growing quickly. But happiness is down by about 1.2 points in the past decade.
America, the subject of Easterlin’s initial study, has again seen happiness fall as the economy has grown. In total the world’s
population looks roughly equally divided between places where happiness and incomes have moved in the same direction
over the past ten years, and places where they have diverged.
