Google says that the 10,000 human evaluators who rate sources for its search engine assess “expertise” and “trustworthiness” but not ideology. Web traffic figures support this defence. Sites with high scores from fact-checking groups, whose judgments probably resemble Google’s, draw larger shares of their visitors from search engines than sites with low scores do.
