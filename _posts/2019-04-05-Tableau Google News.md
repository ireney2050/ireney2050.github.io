Google says that the 10,000 human eval- uators who rate sources for its search en- gine assess “expertise” and “trustworthi- ness” but not ideology. Web-traffic figures support this defence. Sites with high scores from fact-checking groups, whose judgments probably resemble Google’s, draw larger shares of their visitors from search engines than sites with low scores do.
